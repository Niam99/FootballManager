Notes on magit pushing

1. first make sure all files have been either committed or stashed.
2. Then in magit type b b master to change to master.
3. Then pull master with F u.
4. Then go back to your branch with b b development.
5. Rebase the branch. In magit r e master.
6. now go back to master b b master.
7. merge your branch into master: m m development.
8. if all has gone well, you can push master to remote: P u.
9. go back to your branch and do work.

*** COMPLETED Create a personal branch
    CLOSED: [2018-01-30 Tue 09:48]

Simple branching workflow:

- make sure you have ido-mode on as it makes it much easier to select
  the branches.
- create a new branch in magit: Type b c. The starting point should be
  master.Then give it a name (e.g. development).
- do work as usual, commit etc. When you want to push:
  1. first make sure all files have been either committed or stashed.
  2. Then in magit type b b master to change to master.
  3. Then pull master with F u.
  4. Then go back to your branch with b b development.
  5. Rebase the branch. In magit r e master.
  6. now go back to master b b master.
  7. merge your branch into master: m m development.
  8. if all has gone well, you can push master to remote: P u.
  9. go back to your branch and do work.
