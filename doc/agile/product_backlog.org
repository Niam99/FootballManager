This document contains the [[http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-backlog][product backlog]] for Football Manager.

** Create a class for a menu

We need a generic class that allows one to define a menu, with the
following shape:

: description
: menu options
: prompt

For example:

: Main Menu
:
: [1] Choose a team
: [2] View news
: [0] QUit game
:
: Option: _
:
: _

Ensure the user has entered a valid option.

** Add Travis support for project

Travis automatically builds your project every time you do a commit.

- Log in to travis using your github account (this has to be done by
  Niam): https://travis-ci.org/. Create a project for Football
  Manager.
- Create a file called .travis.yml on the top directory of your
  project. See [[https://ledentsov.de/2013/07/06/setting-travis-ci-with-github-for-a-c-project-for-the-first-time-cpp/][Setting travis-ci with github for a c++ project for the
  first time]]
- add an emblem to your readme file. This should appear on your travis
  project, as per article above.

** Create a local branch using magit

In git you should never commit locally to branch master. Look for
tutorials on using multiple branches.

Simple branching workflow:

- make sure you have ido-mode on as it makes it much easier to select
  the branches.
- create a new branch in magit: Type b c. The starting point should be
  master. Then give it a name (e.g. development).
- do work as usual, commit etc. When you want to push:
  - 1. first make sure all files have been either committed or
    stashed.
  - 2. Then in magit type b b master to change to master.
  - 3. Then pull master with F u.
  - 4. Then go back to your branch with b b development.
  - 5. Rebase the branch. In magit r e master.
  - 6. now go back to master b b master.
  - 7. merge your branch into master: m m development.
  - 8. if all has gone well, you can push master to remote: P u.
  - 9. go back to your branch and do work.

** Create a simple main for project

In projects, create a project called:

: football_manager.game

Add a simple main and CMakeLists, and make sure it builds. Commit
this.
