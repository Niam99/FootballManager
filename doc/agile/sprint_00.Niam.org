* Notes

** branch
Simple branching workflow:
 +
 +- make sure you have ido-mode on as it makes it much easier to select
 +  the branches.
 +- create a new branch in magit: Type b c. The starting point should be
 +  master. Then give it a name (e.g. development).
 +- do work as usual, commit etc. When you want to push:
 +  - 1. first make sure all files have been either committed or
 +    stashed.
 +  - 2. Then in magit type b b master to change to master.
 +  - 3. Then pull master with F u.
 +  - 4. Then go back to your branch with b b development.
 +  - 5. Rebase the branch. In magit r e master.
 +  - 6. now go back to master b b master.
 +  - 7. merge your branch into master: m m development.
 +  - 8. if all has gone well, you can push master to remote: P u.
 +  - 9. go back to your branch and do work.
