* Notes

** branch
Simple branching workflow:
 +
 +- make sure you have ido-mode on as it makes it much easier to select
 +  the branches.
 +- create a new branch in magit: Type b c. The starting point should be
 +  master. Then give it a name (e.g. development).
 +- do work as usual, commit etc. When you want to push:
 +  - 1. first make sure all files have been either committed or
 +    stashed.
 +  - 2. Then in magit type b b master to change to master.
 +  - 3. Then pull master with F u.
 +  - 4. Then go back to your branch with b b development.
 +  - 5. Rebase the branch. In magit r e master.
 +  - 6. now go back to master b b master.
 +  - 7. merge your branch into master: m m development.
 +  - 8. if all has gone well, you can push master to remote: P u.
 +  - 9. go back to your branch and do work.

*** COMPLETED Add Travis support for project
    CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 16:54]

Travis automatically builds your project every time you do a commit.

- Log in to travis using your github account (this has to be done by
  Niam): https://travis-ci.org/. Create a project for Football
  Manager.
- Create a file called .travis.yml on the top directory of your
  project. See [[https://ledentsov.de/2013/07/06/setting-travis-ci-with-github-for-a-c-project-for-the-first-time-cpp/][Setting travis-ci with github for a c++ project for the
  first time]]
- add an emblem to your readme file. This should appear on your travis
  project, as per article above.
