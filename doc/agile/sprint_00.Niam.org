Updates to sprint and product backlog

*** COMPLETED Magit
    CLOSED: [2018-01-30 Tue 09:20]

Simple branching workflow:

 - make sure you have ido-mode on as it makes it much easier to select
   the branches.
 - create a new branch in magit: Type b c. The starting point should be
   master. Then give it a name (e.g. development).
 - do work as usual, commit etc. When you want to push:
   1. first make sure all files have been either committed or stashed.
   2. Then in magit type b b master to change to master.
   3. Then pull master with F u.
   4. Then go back to your branch with b b development.
   5. Rebase the branch. In magit r e master.
   6. now go back to master b b master.
   7. merge your branch into master: m m development.
   8. if all has gone well, you can push master to remote: P u.
   9. go back to your branch and do work.

Travis automatically builds your project every time you do a commit.

  Niam): https://travis-ci.org/. Create a project for Football
  Manager.
- Create a file called .travis.yml on the top directory of your
  project. See [[https://ledentsov.de/2013/07/06/setting-travis-ci-with-github-for-a-c-project-for-the-first-time-cpp/][Setting travis-ci with github for a c++ project for the
  first time]]
- add an emblem to your readme file. This should appear on your travis
  project, as per article above.
